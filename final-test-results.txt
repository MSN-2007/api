   - Consistency: 5/25
   - Specificity: 0/25

   📝 Notes:
   - The answer completely avoids addressing the question about the limitations of the deterministic scoring approach.
   - Instead, it provides a generic positive summary of the project's features, largely paraphrasing the README.
   - The phrase 'clean architecture' is an inference not explicitly stated in the README.
   - No specific constraints, tradeoffs, or limitations are mentioned, despite being explicitly asked for.
